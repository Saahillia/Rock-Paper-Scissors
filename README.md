Rock Paper Scissors (Java Swing)
A simple, complete implementation of the classic two-player game, Rock, Paper, Scissors, built using Java's Swing toolkit. This project separates the game logic (backend) from the graphical user interface (frontend) for clear architecture and easy maintenance.

üöÄ Key Features
Interactive Swing GUI with score tracking for the player and computer.
Real-time score update after every round.
Randomized computer choice per round, managed by the backend.
Clear separation of UI components (RockPaperScissorGUI) and game rules (RockPaperScissor).

üìÅ Project Structure
The application is split into three main Java files within the RockPaperScissor package:
App.java: Role: Launcher. Main class containing the main method, responsible for launching the GUI.
RockPaperScissorGUI.java: Role: Frontend. Handles all GUI elements (buttons, labels) and user interactions.
RockPaperScissor.java: Role: Backend. Manages game logic, random choice generation, and score calculation.
